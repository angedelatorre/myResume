    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website. After graduating, I began applying to 
        various companies but faced challenges, especially when it came to 
        technical exams. I developed an interest in programming and started 
        learning it, but I found it difficult to understand. I once applied as a software 
        developer, and after the interview, I was told to go home. While leaving the 
        company, it sank in that I had been rejected.</p>

        <p>After that rejection, I decided to enroll in an online class to learn full-stack 
        web development. Currently, I am working on this HTML website, which 
        serves as my first project for my portfolio. I am determined to continue learning 
        and developing my skills to prepare myself for my first job in the near future.</p>
